1. Choose Phase to plot among the list

2. Load real data:
File > Read Data

3. Setup Time window and filter
Then Click Update Data

4. Align Traces:
Data Analysis > Align Traces
The red traces correspond to the mean trace. The value below the station name is the time residual between the mean trace and each signal.
You can choose to keep or to remove some traces by clicking on the corresponding radiobutton - the mean trace and the time residual map will be automatically updated.

5. Load Synthetic data:
File > Load Synthetic

6. Pick Phase arrival on synthetic (in order to define the matching time window for deconvolution)

7. Deconvolution
red: Mean wavelet
blue: SVD wavelet
green: Meadian wavelet
For each selected station, the new plot represents the calculated wavelet.
